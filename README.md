# EmojiX (Deprecated)

> This Spigot-based 1.11.2 Minecraft plugin adds Minecraft-compliant UTF-8 emoji to chat and signs without all the issues that other plugins such as [Minemojis](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/minemojis.15969/) bring.

EmojiX fixes architectural flaws that you may encounter with other solutions: links get recognized as emoji, emoji in colored chat are tinted, and you are forced to use a resource pack because the emoji are merely Chinese characters that are indescribable outside of the game.

## Features

+ An EULA-compliant donator feature
+ Works well with tools like [DiscordSRV](https://github.com/scarsz/discordsrv)
+ Configurable for everyone’s needs
+ Links are not recognized as emoji
+ You don’t need any resource packs
+ Simple drop-in style installation

## Usage

Find a compiled JAR file (usually present in the releases tab), drop it into the `/plugins/` directory, restart the server, and you are done. From there on, a configuration file should be generated for further changes.
