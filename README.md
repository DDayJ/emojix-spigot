This Spigot 1.11.2 plugin for Minecraft adds Minecraft-compliant UTF-8 emoji to chat and signs without all the issues that other plugins such as [Minemojis](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/minemojis.15969/) bring.

EmojiX fixes architectural flaws that you may encounter with other solutions: links get recognized as emoji, emoji in colored chat are tinted, and you are forced to use a resource pack because the emoji are merely Chinese characters that are indescribable outside of the game.

Keep in mind that this project is still a work in progress!

> As seen on [the Polar Galaxy Minecraft server](https://polargalaxy.com). For enhanced and more stylized emoji, check out [our resource pack “Happle’s Goggles”](https://polargalaxy.com/goggles) or consider creating custom emoji yourself.
